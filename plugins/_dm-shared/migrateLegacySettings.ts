 * Discordmaxxer — legacy settings migration helper
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Diggy
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
 *
 * v0.7.14 renamed the `Discordmaxxer*` plugins to `DM*` for terseness in
 * the settings UI. Vencord stores plugin settings keyed by plugin name, so
 * a naive rename would orphan every user's saved toggles + state.
 *
 * This module runs once on first import: walks `Vencord.PlainSettings.plugins`
 * looking for any of the old `Discordmaxxer*` keys, and if the matching new
 * `DM*` key isn't already populated, copies the old settings forward.
 *
 * The `enabled` field IS copied so user's on/off choice survives the rename.
 * The discordmaxxerDefaults seed only runs on first launch — for upgrading
 * users, the new DM* plugin names start unset (Vencord default = off) unless
 * we forward the old enabled state. The old record is left in place as a
 * rollback safety net (cheap; tiny JSON).
 *
 * Plugins that were renamed import this module via side-effect:
 *     import "../_dm-shared/migrateLegacySettings";
 * Multiple imports are deduplicated by the module-level `migrated` latch.
