 *
 * One-sided escape hatch for the "I hear myself in my friend's screenshare"
 * bug. The friend's WASAPI loopback might be capturing Discord's own
 * playback (= your incoming voice) and re-broadcasting it through their
 * screenshare audio track. v0.7.5's process-exclude default fixes the bug
 * on THEIR side once they update — but if they haven't, this plugin lets
 * YOU mute incoming screenshare audio without asking them to fix anything.
 *
 * Voice chat audio is on a DIFFERENT RTCPeerConnection (no `streamUserId`
 * field on the connection object), so muting screenshare audio leaves your
 * friend's voice fully audible. You only lose the streamer's game/system
 * audio while muted — which is what you wanted anyway when it was echoing
 * your own voice back at you.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *   1. Walk MediaEngineStore.getMediaEngine().connections
 *   2. Filter to those with a streamUserId (= screenshare connections)
 *   3. For each, find the RTCPeerConnection and iterate getReceivers()
 *   4. Set every audio receiver's track.enabled = !muted
 *   5. Subscribe to STREAM_CREATE so newly-joined screenshares inherit the
 *      current mute state
 *
 * Toggle paths:
 *   - Hub panel quick-toggle row (auto-wired via QUICK_TOGGLES)
 *   - Ctrl+Shift+M renderer hotkey (skips input fields)
 *   - Plugin settings panel in Discord settings → Discordmaxxer
